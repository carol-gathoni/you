my covid 19 experience

i recall so well that day,it was on a tuesday ,woke up so tired and cold.Hubby had  contracted covid 19 previously.I
was crystal clear my fate was smilling at me.it was a difficult experience that make me have seizures evertime i remember.The sun scorched so wildly outside while i was stuck in the house with  heavy pajamas,wooly jacket,legwarmers and a scarf on my neck throughout,so abnormal bt it was my normal for about three weeks.All alone in the house since hubby had travelled away for work.simple house chores  felt  so draining.. it seemed so much.. i remained under my  duvet through out..a simpe stretch to get a remote or anything on th table would result to consistense  cough until i cud feel my heart i cud tel wea it is located  .it was painful.i had lost taste and apetite ..i managed by pain killers and some traditional corncotions water mixed with ginger lemom and honey.WAs in denial dint want to go to hospital to confirm wat i was suffering from.wat for?I already knew  wat was ailing me and i was fine by that .maybe i was ignorant bt i felt i dint need medication ,was there even any in hospital? so y go? it was a desperate console to my heart and my piece of cold meat.By the third week i was feeling beetter..i had fully recoverd.Thanks to God

       I journeyed on well for  a couple of weeks .one evening Hubby came from work complaining of chest pains now the second time..The love of my life kept threatening my life bt was i to leave him and come when he gets well? wea wud i go that corona dint exist?the virus was evrywhere so i had to stick and face the monster head on,, It is for better for worse anyway..I had not seen hubby this weak.He was pale,weak and he kept coughing.especially at night while others were asleep.felt like nyumba kumi wud pounce on us in the morning and force us to hospital.The next moring he woke up sweaty and the fever was too high..i recall hubby comming from the toilet with blood oozing from his nosetrils and it was all over his clothes..i jumped out of bed to assist him seat on the couch thanks to our small bedsitter i got to him fast.told him we must go the hospital bt he said it was a simple nose bleed.so i helped him on the couch and made him sit upright as i put a cold cloth on his face to stop the bleeding.he insisted he is not going to hospital and kept seying he was not sick..mine was denial bt for his case i was sure its the ego with men the heroic menatality and braveness bt i cud not let him have a way out of this..hospital was must.

     It was lunch hour so doctors are on break till two so we took a small nap.we woke up at exactly 2:30 and headed to hospital.our temperatures were taken at the gate and to uor surprice it was 35 degress for both of us.thot my hubby's cud shoot since he was  sick.he told mi that we shud escape from hospital he was well anyway bt that was according to him told him we must proceed cant come all the way jst to return unattended it cud be waste of time..he took lab tests and an exray only for the result to come out as a normal cold.When we came home he got worse..he coughd for almost two hours consistently it was around 9:pm. I kold a motorbike to take me to a chemist and get medicines to stop the cough.At least fo the night.the pharmacist dint seperate the amount and the number of times to take the dose. It read 10ml5*3 and the 5 looked like s so he took 5 cups and the bottle was half in instant..it seemed so wierd and as hubby was reading the leaflet ..he noticed he had taken an over dose..I felt like dying this time i was trying to come into terms of almost losing him..i was sweating profusely as kold a cab to take us to hospital..by this time his eyes were red as he tried to put fingers in his mouth to vomit the medicine.he said hes not going to hospital..his sturbboness wud cause him i rumbelled bt according to the way he vomited i was convinced there was no medicine left in his stomach since we noticed the error early enough.i dint sleep.i watched over him the whole night.The next day  we decided to seek a second opinion.He took a covid test and it was positive..a friend of his sent some medications hed got from a high end hospital and we bought them the following day 

           The medicines seemed to work jst a day after taking them he started feeling better.Days went by and he continued getting better.Iwas  glad he was getting better bt was scared at the thought of him getting well and the disease wud manifest in me since its obvias i had contracted it.To my surprse i noted i was not ailing..or mayb its bkoz am blood type o+ and my immune is high or is it because i had contracted it previouly and got immune to it..I thot to my self bt i Surely know its not either of the two it is God who shielded me..as am fishing typing these am googling where i can get the vaccine jab and am damn eager have it..even at a price..covid is real.Please social distance,wear a mask and follow minister of health guidelines since the disease is still here with us..keep safe.for u hubby,love u to the moon and back.
